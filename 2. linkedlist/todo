
1. Reversal:

    Description: Reverse the order of nodes in the linked list.
    Importance: Important for various applications and can be a good exercise for understanding pointers.

	- Using iteration
	- Using recursion

2. Detecting a Cycle:

    Description: Check if there is a loop in the linked list.
    Importance: Detecting cycles is crucial to prevent infinite loops and to identify and eliminate bugs.

3. Finding the Middle Node:

    Description: Find the middle node of the linked list.
    Importance: Useful in various algorithms and for dividing a list into halves.

4. Merging Two Sorted Lists:

    Description: Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list.
    Importance: Important in the merge step of merge sort and useful in various applications.

5. Detecting and Removing Duplicates:

    Description: Identify and remove duplicate nodes from a linked list.
    Importance: Helps maintain data integrity and is a common operation in real-world applications.

6. Intersection Point in Y Shaped Linked Lists:

    Description: Find the node where two linked lists intersect.
    Importance: Useful in scenarios where two linked lists share a common section.

7. Cloning with Random Pointers:

    Description: Clone a linked list with next and random pointers.
    Importance: A more advanced algorithm, useful when dealing with complex data structures.
