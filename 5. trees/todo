Binary Tree Traversal:
    Implement in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals of a binary tree.

Binary Search Tree (BST) Validation:
    Check whether a given binary tree is a valid binary search tree.

Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) in a Binary Tree:
    Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree.

Level Order Traversal (BFS) of a Binary Tree:
    Perform level order traversal of a binary tree.

Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal:
    Given preorder and inorder traversals of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Maximum Depth of Binary Tree:
    Find the maximum depth of a binary tree.

Diameter of Binary Tree:
    Find the diameter (longest path between two nodes) of a binary tree.

Symmetric Tree:
    Check if a binary tree is symmetric.

Sum of Root to Leaf Binary Numbers:
    Calculate the sum of binary numbers represented by root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree.

Binary Tree Right Side View:
    Return the right side view of a binary tree.
